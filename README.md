This is the calibration program to be used with the MMDVM. It is started by
adding the serial port onto the command line. On Windows the serial port must be
prefixed with \\.\ as in \\.\COM4 to be valid. Once started the program takes
the following commands:

H/h				Display help
I					Toggle transmit inversion
i					Toggle receive inversion
P/p				Toggle PTT inversion
Q/q				Quit
R					Increase receive level
r					Decrease receive level
T					Increase transmit level
